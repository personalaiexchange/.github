## Introduction

### Get started with the PAIX Protocol — a Private AI eXchange

**PAIX is an open protocol for email that standardizes how personal AI agents connect, communicate, and act on behalf of individuals.**

It doesn't replace email — it extends it.
PAIX builds on the world's most universal communication system to give people and their AI twins a shared, flexible interface with services, providers, and other agents.

Think of PAIX like a USB-C connector for personal AI — it doesn't define the data inside the message (that's up to the sender), but it standardizes the interface logic:
Who sends the message, how it can be received, and how it can be acted on — by both humans and agents.

### What PAIX enables:

* A **shared communication channel** between users, their personal AIs, and the services they interact with
* **Autonomous yet user-controlled agent interactions** — powered by email, but with added structure when needed
* A **gradual, adoption-friendly path** for services: from doing nothing (just receiving email) to recognizing and responding to PAIX-enhanced messages
* **Seamless layering with existing protocols** like MCP — using PAIX for interface logic and MCP (or others) for structured payloads

### PAIX is:

* **Open and implementation-neutral** — no vendor lock-in, no exclusive formats
* **Built for the real world** — works today, with existing infrastructure
* **Agent-ready by design** — assumes users have personal AIs that can act and respond under their guidance
* **User-owned and portable** — PAIX addresses can be created, rotated, or revoked at any time
* **Secure and privacy-aligned** — with optional verifiable credentials, cryptographic signing, and zero-knowledge trust models

### PAIX is not:

* A new content or context format
* An attempt to replace APIs
* A hard dependency on any specific infrastructure or AI system

Instead, **PAIX complements existing protocols and standards** — like using MCP inside a PAIX email message to define the payload, while PAIX handles identity, routing, access, and trust.
